## CO2 emission: Regression Analysis with Visualization

This project analyzes CO2 emissions, linked to the rise in vehicles and climate change. We use data visualizations to understand trends and linear regression to find what drives emissions most (like vehicle use). By checking our models carefully, we aim to give reliable information to policymakers so they can create solutions to fight climate change. This project will help us understand the connection between vehicles and CO2 emissions, leading to a more sustainable future.

## Objectives:
Our initial goal is:

Impact of Engine Size in the Fuel Consumption and CO2 Emission.
Average Fuel Consumption for different Vehicle Classes.
Effect of different Fuel Types.
Predict the Fuel Consumption based on Linear Regression model and evaluation of the model.
Predict the CO2 Emission based on Linear Regression model and evaluation of the model.
K-means Clustering the level of Fuel Consumption based on different parameters
Procedures in this task:
Data Acquisition
Data Mining and Preparation for further analysis
Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Modelling and evaluation

## Tools and Technologies:
### Required Tools:
Programming Language: Python
Notebook: Jupyter
Required Libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn (machine learning and statistical packages)

## About this data: The dataset is a collection of automotive data, likely describing various attributes of different car models. Here's a brief description of each column:
Make: The brand or manufacturer of the vehicle.

Model: The specific model name of the vehicle.

Vehicle Class: The classification of the vehicle, such as compact, SUV, etc.

Engine Size (L): The size of the vehicle's engine, measured in liters.

Cylinders: The number of cylinders in the vehicle's engine.

Transmission: The type of transmission, such as automatic (AS) or manual (M).

Fuel Type: The type of fuel the vehicle uses, such as gasoline (Z).

Fuel Consumption City (L/100 km): The fuel consumption rate in liters per 100 kilometers while driving in the city.

Fuel Consumption Hwy (L/100 km): The fuel consumption rate in liters per 100 kilometers while driving on the highway.

Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km): The combined fuel consumption rate in liters per 100 kilometers, including both city and highway driving.

Fuel Consumption Comb (mpg): The equivalent fuel consumption rate in miles per gallon (mpg).

CO2 Emissions (g/km): The amount of carbon dioxide emissions produced by the vehicle, measured in grams per kilometer.
